Use the table below as a guided structure to analyse the financial reporting quality of both companies based on the four enhancing qualitative characteristics of financial reporting. You are required to (1) find relevant statements in their annual reports, (2) paraphrase or summarise them to evidence the quality of reporting from the four perspectives, and (3) provide suggestions for the smaller company to improve its financial reporting quality. You may write in four paragraphs instead of using a table, ensuring one concise statement for each criterion.

Question 2 – Evaluating Financial Reporting Practices (50 marks, around 600 words)Creative accounting can influence how a company’s financial position is presented. To explore this, choose a company from the FTSE 250 index on the London Stock Exchange: https://www.londonstockexchange.com/live-markets/market-data-dashboard/price-explorer.

Required:(1) Review its most recent annual report and identify an accounting policy or practice that could potentially be seen as "creative" based on the Criteria below. (10 marks)(2) Explain how this practice affects the presentation of the financial statements. (15 marks)(3) Discuss whether this practice appears to align with or challenge ethical accounting standards, as outlined by IFRS or UK GAAP. (10 marks)(4) Finally, suggest a recommendation to enhance transparency or ethical compliance based on your findings. (15 marks)You are encouraged to use the information and disclosures available in the annual report, such as all the general-purpose financial statements and management’s commentary, to identify and analyse these practices.  While the annual report may not provide all details, it is sufficient to make an informed assessment based on what is disclosed. This question is to assess the module Learning Outcome 2 (LO2, mapping with Course LO3 and LO4): evaluate the ethical implications of financial accounting disclosure practices for various external user groups.
Criteria:
When analysing the annual report, focus on these areas:
1. Revenue Recognition Policies: Look at how the company records revenue. Does it mention recognising revenue for sales that are not yet fully completed or delivered? This may indicate aggressive revenue recognition.
2. Depreciation and Asset Valuation: Review the notes on assets and depreciation methods. If the company uses methods that extend asset life significantly or revalues assets frequently without clear market justification, this could be an indication of overvaluation.
3. Presentation of Key Ratios and Figures: Look at how the company highlights its financial performance in management’s discussion and analysis.  Are they emphasising profit margins, but not discussing debt levels or other risks? This could be an example of selective presentation to make the company appear stronger.
4. Changes in Accounting Policies: If the company has made recent changes to its accounting policies (e.g., switching the method代 写N1609 Advanced Financial Accounting Problem Set, November 2024 (A1)R

Ensure clarity, evidence-based analysis, and structured presentation throughout the response.Guidance on the Use of Generative AI for Question 1 and Question 2 (10 marks):You are required to use Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) as a research assistant where appropriate to help contextualise the question and draft possible answers. However, any text generated by the AI during your research and analysis must be included in an Appendix attached to your answers for the two questions.  This appendix will not be included in the word count and will not be marked.  Your task is to demonstrate the refinement and development of your final answers by showing how you improved upon the AI-generated text. Specifically, you must:1. Include References: Provide the page numbers from the annual reports and any other references you used to support your analysis. (2 marks)2. Summarise or Paraphrase: Condense or rephrase the AI-generated text to demonstrate your understanding and learning. (2 marks)3. Correct and Update Information: Cross-check the AI-generated content against academic sources or the most up-to-date information, especially where the AI may have outdated or missing data and make necessary corrections. (3 marks)4. Enhance Relevance and Application: Improve the clarity and relevance of the response by tailoring it to the specific question context. Incorporate specific examples and ensure the application of accounting principles is accurate and relevant. (3 marks)This approach will help you engage critically with the AI tool, refine your research and analytical skills, and produce answers that reflect your own understanding and academic rigor. Failure to follow these guidelines, such as not including the AI-generated text in an appendix or not demonstrating sufficient improvement and understanding, may result in a deduction of marks.General Requirements to Question 1 and 2:Your answers are to be your own work.  You are to use Harvard referencing style. to reference any material you have directly or indirectly taken from other sources.  Accounting standards may be cited by simply giving the abbreviation for the standard (IAS, IFRS, etc.), its number and the paragraph to which you refer.  There is no lower- or upper-word count limits for each of your answers to the questions.  The overall word count is suggested to be 1,000 words +/- 10%. You will not get penalised if you write longer than 1,000 words, up to 2,000 words.Marks will be awarded according to the University of Sussex Business School Generic Assessment Criteria 2020. Please make sure you watch the video under Marking Scheme(s) on N1609 Module Canvas Page under Assessment Information and read the ‘Expected at level 6’ carefully before writing up your answers.  Marks will be given based on the quality of your writing from 5 perspectives including: (1) Knowledge  Understanding, (2) Application, (3) Critical Thinking, (4) Reading  Research, and (5) Presentation  Style.  (Teamwork criterion is irrelevant to this assessment.)  Your submission will be checked for plagiarism automatically using the Turn-it-in.
